## Code Analysis/Scanning
### Configuring repository for GitHub CodeQL
[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/) is the analysis engine used by developers to automate security checks, and by security researchers to perform variant analysis.

In CodeQL, code is treated like data. Security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other errors are modeled as queries that can be executed against databases extracted from code. You can run the standard CodeQL queries, written by GitHub researchers and community contributors, or write your own to use in custom analyses. Queries that find potential bugs highlight the result directly in the source file.
